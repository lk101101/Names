## Overview
The US Social Security Administration (SSA) publishes annual lists of baby names used during that year. This program processes the data from the most recent dataset (2020) and a specified birth year and compares the number of babies named a specific name depending on the gender. Currently, the only options for gender are male (m) and female (f) so gender neutral names would require additional searches.

Example:\
Enter as name gender (m/f) year\
Input: emma f 2010\
Output: The girls' name EMMA was used 15581 times in 2020 and 17351 times in 2010

For all of the annual datasets (ranging all the way to 1880), download 'National data' on the SSA site:  https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html
