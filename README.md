# Under construction! Adding Flask functionality ðŸš§

## Overview

The US Social Security Administration (SSA) publishes annual lists of baby names used during that year. This program can:

1. return random first name(s) from a random year with options to specify gender (m/f), number of names to generate, and whether to generate a surname
2. retrieve information about a specified name's origin and meaning scraped from NameBerry.com as well as its predicted nationality, age, and gender gathered from the Nationalize.io, Genderize.io, and Agify.io APIs
3. Creates data visualizations to display the changes in a name's popularity throughout a specified range of years

Currently, the only options for gender are male (m) and female (f).

# How to Download and Run Code

* In your Terminal, run ' git clone https://github.com/lk101101/Names ' to clone this repo into your directory.
* Navigate to the new folder called Names.
* Create a Python environment (i.e. 'python -m venv env', then 'source env/bin/activate') and run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to download the required packages.
* Run 'python gather_data.py' to download the required datasets ('National Data' from https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html and 'Surnames Occurring 100+ Times' from https://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/2010_surnames.html). The names_files folder contains a small sample of both datasets.
