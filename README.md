## Overview
The US Social Security Administration (SSA) publishes annual lists of baby names used during that year. This program
1. processes the data from the most recent dataset (2020) and the dataset from specified year
2. prints number of babies named with specified name in specified year and current year
3. displays a line graph visualizing the change in popularity from specified year to current year

Currently, the only options for gender are male (m) and female (f) so retrieving data for gender neutral names would require two searches.

Example:\
Enter as name gender (m/f) year\
Input: emma f 2010\
Output: The girls' name EMMA was used 15581 times in 2020 and 17351 times in 2010

For all of the annual datasets (ranging all the way to 1880), download 'National data' on the SSA site:  https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html

## TO DO
Planning to do more interesting things with the code and data!
